# Adobe Captivate Project - EDTC 5312

This repository hosts my Adobe Captivate project developed for EDTC 5312. The project demonstrates my skills in educational technology design and implementation, showcasing interactive learning experiences I've created. This GitHub Pages site serves as both documentation and presentation of my work in the field of educational technology.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts an Adobe Captivate project developed for EDTC 5312, demonstrating educational technology design skills through interactive learning experiences. The project is a student-centered, multimedia e-learning assessment module focused on Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N3 level vocabulary and grammar. This module serves as a practice examination environment mirroring the official JLPT N3 test format and difficulty. Rather than providing instructional content, it functions as an assessment tool for users who have already studied N3-level material independently. The module features multiple-choice questions modeled after actual test items, assessment of N3-specific grammar structures and vocabulary, immediate feedback with explanations, and performance tracking to identify knowledge gaps requiring additional study. While the JLPT covers reading and listening comprehension as well, this module concentrates exclusively on grammar and vocabulary components to maintain a focused assessment approach.
